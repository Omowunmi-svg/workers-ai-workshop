  <p>
    In this hands-on session, you will learn how to harness the power of Cloudflare's global network and Workers AI to create smart conversational chatbots. By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills to develop your own chatbots capable of engaging in natural and interesting conversations.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into building your ChatGPT clone, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- __Cloudflare Account__: You'll need an active Cloudflare account. If you don't have one, [sign up at Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

- __Basic Knowledge of JavaScript__: Familiarity with JavaScript will be beneficial, as we will be writing code to deploy the chatbot.

- __A Code Editor__: You should have a code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Stackblitz, GitHub Codespaces, or any other) installed on your system or accessible on your browser.

## Lab 1: Getting Started

To create a new project named `workers-ai-chatgpt-clone`, follow these steps:

1. Open your command-line interface (CLI) and run the following command:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

2. During the setup process, you will be prompted to provide information. Please respond to the prompts as follows:

- For the directory where your project will be created, enter `workers-ai-chatgpt-clone`.
- Choose the `Hello World` script as the type of application you intend to build.
- Opt not to use TypeScript by selecting `No`.
- Opt to use Git by selecting `Yes`.
- Choose not to deploy your application at this point by selecting `No`.

3. Once you've completed these prompts, a new directory named `workers-ai-chatgpt-clone` will be generated, containing the following files:

- A "Hello World" Worker located at `src/index.js`.
- A `wrangler.toml` configuration file.

This setup will prepare you to begin working on your project.

## Deploy your Worker


## Next Steps

Once you've completed this workshop, you're on your way to creating more advanced chatbots and exploring the full potential of Workers AI. Here are some next steps to consider:

<!-- TODO: Add one more to help their chatbot look more like chatgpt they can add a bit of styling / use the shadcdn drop-in component -->

- Modify your chatbot to suit your specific needs. You can teach it industry-specific jargon, incorporate your branding, and tailor its behavior.

- Join the Cloudflare Discord community, and share what you've built.
